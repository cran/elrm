Release 1.2

Decreased the progress incrememt when generating the Markov chain from 20% to 5% intervals. This was done to improve the memory requirements.
Fixed a small bug in the 'elrm' and 'update' methods that wrongly repeated the last sampled response vector in the next batch.
Added a check that 'iter' and 'burnIn' are integer values in the 'elrm' and 'update' methods.
Added a check that the Markov chain that is used for conducting inference is atleast of size 1000 in the 'update' method.

Release 1.2.1

Fixed an include statement in matrix.h which was causing make to fail in Linux.
